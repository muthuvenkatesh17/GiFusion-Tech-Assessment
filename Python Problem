## Problems and Solutions

### 1. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

**Description**:  
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `s = "abcabcbb"`
- **Output**: `3`
- **Explanation**: The longest substring without repeating characters is "abc", which has a length of 3.

**Solution**:  
The solution involves using a sliding window approach with a dictionary to track the indices of characters. The algorithm updates the window size based on the presence of repeating characters to ensure it only contains unique characters.
